<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

I want to create a repository to share with the world how I approach the core concepts of JavaScript -- You can find all about it in this repository

Codes related to basic JS concepts of Javascript syntax, variables, functions, conditional structures, loops/iterations etc

Here's why:

- You shouldn't be opening stackoverflow everytime just because you are weak at the concepts instead you should go through this repository and learn the concepts so that it can save you your precious time .
- This will help you better understand and debug JavaScript :smile:

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## js1

In this file , you will find more about execution context

The code is basically about declaring a variable with no initial value and then running it through a loop resulting in value change. The concepts of functions, conditional statemets and loops have been used.

The function is declared in the first step.

A variable is declared in the function with an initial value of undefined and that value is printed # in JS, undefined is treated as a value for a variale if no assignment is made to it.
The variable is iterated through a for loop with a change of value from firstly undefined, then 0 uptil 4.

After the loop ends, a line of code is executed after that.

The function is closed and called in the next step.

As soon as the function is called, the whole code inside it is executed in real terms on the screen.
The function can also be called before even declaring the function, because JS Debugger initializes it at the start of the code and looks for the function throughout the whole code, the moment it is called.
